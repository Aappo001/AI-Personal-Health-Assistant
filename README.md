# Getting Started
To build project you must have [cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your system.
1. Clone the repo locally
```
git clone https://github.com/Aappo001/AI-Personal-Health-Assistant.git
cd AI-Personal-Health-Assistant
```
2. Set required environment variables inside a `.env` file. The JWT_KEY variable must be set in order for the project to compile. The value of the variable does not matter, just make sure it is consistent. HF_API_KEY is needed to generate AI responses, you can get yours [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
```
cd api
echo "JWT_KEY={YOUR_JWT_KEY}" >> .env
echo "HF_API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}" >> .env
echo "SQLX_OFFLINE=true" >> .env
```
3. Build the backend with cargo
```
cargo b -r
```
4. Build the frontend with vite/npm
```
cd ../client
npm i
npm run build
```
5. Start up the backend server
```
cd ../api
cargo r -r
```
6. Visit `https://localhost:3000` in your browser
